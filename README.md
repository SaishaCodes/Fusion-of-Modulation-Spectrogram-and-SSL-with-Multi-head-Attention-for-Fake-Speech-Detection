# Fusion-of-Modulation-Spectrogram-and-SSL-with-Multi-head-Attention-for-Fake-Speech-Detection
This repository features code for our APSIPA 2025 paper on Fine-grained Sound Detection, fusing wav2vec 2.0 XLS-R SSL representations with modulation spectrograms via multi-head attention for robust domain generalization. Includes tools for reproducible FSD experiments and benchmarking.
